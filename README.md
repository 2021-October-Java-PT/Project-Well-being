Project Well-beingâ€™s Unboxed Thoughts

Unboxed Thoughts is a well-being and mental health tracker. The purpose of the app is to provide assistance in tracking mental health over time and to discover what interventions are working. Many mental health professionals have their clients track episodes of different struggles that they are dealing with to go over in sessions. This app provides a more consistent place to track and share that information.

Unboxed Thoughts allows:

1. A user to set reminders
2. A user to create journal entries
3. A user to select the type of parameter they want to track via forms on depression, anxiety, etc.
4. A user to perform daily checkin's
5. A user to share information with a provider
6. A provider to visualize the data in a variety of ways
7. Provides users with the ability to search and find resources on a variety of topics and practice mindfulness
